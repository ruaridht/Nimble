//	Info regarding the images:
//	All images should be at least 512x512 (height and width ratio must be 1:1).
//	The centerImage and mouseImage will scale 1:1 â€“ so they should be made together.
//	The appBG will act as a background for the app images and needs to be at least 20% bigger than the image size used (typically empty).
//	The ringBG should be as big as possible.  Since it will act as the core background for the ring (though typically empty).
