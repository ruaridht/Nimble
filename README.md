# Nimble (application switcher) #
Ruaridh Thomson

The Xcode project for an application switcher.

Invoked in a similar manner to cmd+tab, the app presents currently running apps around a ring instead of in a line.

## Features ##
* Shows a ring in the centre of the screen, populated with currently running apps.
* Provides some support for customisation (background, placement, hotkeys)
